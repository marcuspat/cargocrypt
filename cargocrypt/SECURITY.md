# CargoCrypt Security Guide

## Overview

CargoCrypt implements enterprise-grade cryptographic security with comprehensive protections against modern attack vectors. This document outlines the security features, threat model, and best practices for secure usage.

## Security Features

### Core Cryptographic Security

#### Authenticated Encryption
- **Primary Algorithm**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 (default)
  - Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
  - Resistant to timing and cache-timing attacks
  - Post-quantum secure
  - No known vulnerabilities in software implementations

- **Secondary Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (optional)
  - Industry standard with hardware acceleration
  - Potential side-channel vulnerabilities in software
  - Recommended only with hardware AES-NI support

#### Key Derivation
- **Algorithm**: Argon2id (latest version)
- **Protection Levels**:
  - Basic: 8MB memory, 1 iteration, 1 thread
  - Standard: 64MB memory, 3 iterations, 4 threads
  - High: 256MB memory, 5 iterations, 8 threads
  - Paranoid: 1GB memory, 10 iterations, 16 threads

#### Random Number Generation
- **Source**: OS cryptographic random number generator (OsRng)
- **Entropy Validation**: Basic statistical tests to detect obvious failures
- **Secure Memory**: All random data uses secure buffers with automatic zeroization

### Attack Mitigations

#### Timing Attack Prevention
- **Constant-time operations**: All critical cryptographic operations use constant-time implementations
- **Minimum operation time**: Configurable minimum execution time to prevent timing analysis
- **Random jitter**: Optional random delays to obfuscate timing patterns
- **Password verification**: Uses constant-time comparison for all password operations

#### Side-Channel Attack Resistance
- **Memory access patterns**: Designed to minimize data-dependent memory accesses
- **Cache-line alignment**: Sensitive data structures aligned to prevent cache-line sharing
- **Algorithm selection**: ChaCha20-Poly1305 preferred for its resistance to cache-timing attacks
- **Secure memory**: Cache-aligned buffers with padding to prevent information leakage

#### Memory Protection
- **Automatic zeroization**: All sensitive data automatically cleared from memory
- **Secure buffers**: Custom SecureBuffer type with guaranteed cleanup
- **Stack protection**: Sensitive operations use heap-allocated secure memory
- **Memory alignment**: 64-byte alignment for cache-line protection

#### Information Leakage Prevention
- **Debug implementations**: Sensitive data redacted in debug output
- **Error messages**: Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- **Serialization**: Only encrypted data is serialized, never plaintext

## Protection Levels

### Basic Protection
- **Use case**: Development, testing, non-sensitive data
- **Performance**: Fastest operations
- **Security**: Basic protections, suitable for low-threat environments
- **Key derivation**: Minimal parameters for speed

### Standard Protection (Default)
- **Use case**: General production use
- **Performance**: Balanced security and performance
- **Security**: Comprehensive protection against common attacks
- **Key derivation**: Moderate parameters for good security

### High Protection

## Threat Model

### Threats Addressed

#### Local Adversary
- **Memory dumps**: Protected by automatic zeroization
- **Swap files**: Mitigated by secure memory allocation
- **Core dumps**: Sensitive data cleared before potential crashes
- **Process memory**: Constant-time operations prevent timing analysis

#### Network Adversary
- **Man-in-the-middle**: Not applicable (local encryption)
- **Traffic analysis**: Not applicable (local encryption)
- **Protocol attacks**: Not applicable (no network protocol)

#### Side-Channel Adversary
- **Timing attacks**: Constant-time operations and minimum timing
- **Cache-timing attacks**: Algorithm choice and memory layout
- **Power analysis**: Software protections where possible
- **Electromagnetic emanations**: Standard software mitigations

#### Cryptographic Adversary
- **Known plaintext**: AEAD provides authenticated encryption

- **Chosen ciphertext**: Authentication tag prevents tampering
- **Differential cryptanalysis**: ChaCha20 is resistant to differential attacks

### Threats Not Addressed

#### Physical Adversary
- **Hardware tampering**: Requires hardware security modules
- **Physical key extraction**: Software-only solution cannot prevent
- **Cold boot attacks**: Requires hardware memory encryption
- **DMA attacks**: Requires IOMMU or hardware protections

#### Social Engineering
- **Password extraction**: Users must protect passwords
- **Credential theft**: Multi-factor authentication recommended
- **Insider threats**: Access controls are application responsibility

#### Advanced Persistent Threats
- **Code injection**: Requires system-level protections
- **Rootkit installation**: Requires OS-level security
- **Supply chain attacks**: Requires secure development practices

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Password Management
```rust
// Use strong passwords with validation
let engine = HardenedCryptoEngine::new(ProtectionLevel::High);
let result = engine.encrypt_secure(data, strong_password, None).await;

// Never log or print passwords
// ❌ Don't do this
println!("Password: {}", password);

// ✅ Do this instead
tracing::info!("Password validation completed");
```

#### Protection Level Selection
```rust
// Choose appropriate protection level
let protection_level = match sensitivity {
    DataSensitivity::Low => ProtectionLevel::Basic,
    DataSensitivity::Medium => ProtectionLevel::Standard,
    DataSensitivity::High => ProtectionLevel::High,
    DataSensitivity::Classified => ProtectionLevel::Paranoid,
};
```

#### Error Handling
```rust
// Handle errors securely - don't leak information
match crypto_operation() {
    Ok(result) => result,
    Err(_) => {
        // ❌ Don't expose detailed error information
        // return Err(format!("Crypto failed: {}", e));
        
        // ✅ Use generic error messages
        return Err("Cryptographic operation failed".to_string());
    }
}
```

#### Memory Management
```rust
// Use secure buffers for sensitive data
let mut sensitive_data = SecureBuffer::new(32);
// Data is automatically zeroized when dropped

// Explicitly clear sensitive variables when possible
let mut password = get_password();
// ... use password ...
password.zeroize(); // Clear immediately after use
```

### For System Administrators

#### Environment Security
- Ensure adequate system memory for chosen protection level
- Use systems with hardware random number generators when available
- Enable memory protection features (ASLR, DEP, stack canaries)
- Monitor for unusual memory or CPU usage patterns

#### Deployment Considerations
- Use Paranoid protection level for classified data
- Implement proper access controls around encrypted data
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Monitor audit logs for security events

### For End Users

#### Password Security
- Use long, complex passwords (minimum 12 characters)
- Include mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid dictionary words and common patterns
- Use unique passwords for different encrypted datasets

#### Operational Security
- Protect passwords using proper password managers
- Avoid entering passwords on shared or untrusted systems
- Clear clipboard after copying encrypted data
- Regularly rotate encryption passwords for sensitive data

## Security Audit and Monitoring

### Audit Logging
```rust
// Security operations are automatically logged
let engine = HardenedCryptoEngine::new(ProtectionLevel::High);

// Get audit statistics
let stats = engine.get_security_stats().await;
println!("Security operations: {}", stats.total_operations);
println!("Success rate: {:.2}%", 
    stats.successful_operations as f64 / stats.total_operations as f64 * 100.0);

// Review audit log
let audit_log = engine.get_audit_log().await;
for entry in audit_log {
    if !entry.success {
        eprintln!("Failed operation: {} at {}", entry.operation, entry.timestamp);
    }
}
```

### Security Assessment
```rust
// Perform security audit
let audit_result = engine.security_audit().await;

if !audit_result.timing_protection {
    eprintln!("Warning: Timing attack protection disabled");
}

if !audit_result.memory_protection {
    eprintln!("Warning: Memory protection not active");
}

// Check for recommendations
for recommendation in &audit_result.recommendations {
    eprintln!("Security recommendation: {}", recommendation);
}
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor key derivation times for anomalies
- Track memory usage during cryptographic operations
- Verify entropy quality in random number generation
- Assess timing variance in password verification
